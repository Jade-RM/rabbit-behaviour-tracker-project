# rabbit-behaviour-tracker-project
Personal research project to analyse behaviour of pet rabbits

This is a simple web-based tracker built using javascript and D3.js to log typical rabbit activities/behaviours using timestamps, with optional notes. The tracker is set to observe one male and one female rabbit. It creates bar charts to log and compare the behaviour of each rabbit. Because I wish to use my data to analyse the proportion of total and individual activities that the rabbits do together, it also includes a summary of shared/solo behaviours and displays a percentage of shared/solo behaviours in each bar (which also change colour depending if more than 50% of activities are done together). The data is saved in local storage and logs can be made until the tracker is manually reset by clicking and confirming the reset button. A CSV file for each rabbit can be downloaded at any time in order to analyse the logged data. 
The parameters for this tracker are based on my personal aims for this research project. The tracker itself can be modified for use to observe behaviours in other species, number and sex of animals.
The tracker is available for viewing and use here: https://jade-rm.github.io/rabbit-behaviour-tracker-project/
Disclaimer: ChatGPT was used to assist and troubleshoot in the creation of this tracker. All ideas, concepts and aims for the tracker and the research project are solely my own.

Data was collected by observing a pair of bonded rabbits for one month in order to answer the following research question:
"What is the distribution of daily shared and solo activities of bonded rabbits, and which behaviours occur most frequently?"
